		<h2> Why was <span class="font-weight-bold font-color-maroon"> MUSBE </span> created? </h3>
		
		<p>
			The site was created to make the process of buying and selling university materials a simpler task while protecting the user’s privacy.

			<h2> The Team </h3>
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold font-color-maroon"> Seadrique Mosville</h3>

			<i class="font-size-em-10"> Head Graphics Designer </i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Cedric is a 3rd year Civil Engineering student at McMaster and loves eating hamburgers.
		</p>

		<p>
			He experienced the hassles of finding his textbooks when he was in first year, so he provided the necessary insight for making MUSBE an online tool tailored to students.
		</p>

		<p>
			Cedric has a background of doing art which had led him to becoming a part-time graphics designer and creating what MUSBE looks like right now. MUSBE was also his first site he has ever designed in his life! Woot!
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold font-color-maroon"> Yi Chen Zhu </h3>

			<i class="font-size-em-10"> Developer </i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yi Chen is a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the University of Toronto.
		</p>
		<p>
			His main role was to code Cedric’s designs and make them come to life on the internet. This is his first time creating a site this big from scratch and it took some balls to do so!
		</p>
		<p>

			Yi Chen specializes in back-end development where he programs the magic that happens whenever a button is clicked or an account is created. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold font-color-maroon"> Stephanie Tran </h3>

			<i class="font-size-em-10"> Marketer </i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Stephanie is a 4th year Chemical Engineering student at McMaster.
		</p>
		<p>
			She is very enthusiastic and loves to meet new people, and so she made sure as many people as possible knew about MUSBE.
